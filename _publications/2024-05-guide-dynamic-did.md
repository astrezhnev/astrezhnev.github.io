excerpt: 'Difference-in-differences (DiD) designs for estimating causal effects have grown in popu-larity throughout political science.  It is common for DiD studies report their main results using a “dynamic” or “event study” two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regression.  This regres-sion combines estimates of average treatment effects for multiple post-treatment time periods alongside placebo tests of the main identifying assumption:  parallel trends.  Despite their ubiquity,  there  is  little  clear  and  consistent  guidance  in  the  discipline  for  how  researchersshould estimate dynamic treatment effects.  This paper develops a novel decomposition ofthe  dynamic  TWFE  regression  coefficients  in  terms  of  their  component  2×2  difference-in-differences comparisons in the style of Goodman-Bacon (2021).  We use this decompositionto  illustrate  how  bias  can  result  from  the  incorrect  specification  of  baseline  time  periods, the inclusion of units and time periods where all observations are treated, and heterogene-ity in the dynamic treatment effects across different treatment timing groups.  Our resultsprovide additional intuition for the source of bias due to effect heterogeneity — what Sun and Abraham  (2021)  term  “contamination  bias” — by  directly  characterizing  the  contaminated 2×2 comparisons.  We then provide a common framework for connecting the many proposed“heterogeneity-robust” estimators in the literature, noting that they vary primarily in which 2×2 comparisons they choose to include.  Through a replication of three studies published inprominent political science journals, we conclude by showing how attentiveness to baseline selection and specification can alter findings'

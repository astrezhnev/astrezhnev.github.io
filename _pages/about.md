I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I received my PhD in 2018 from the [Department of Government](https://gov.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and was previously an Assistant Professor at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) from 2021-2025. Prior to this, I was a faculty fellow at [NYU's Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) and an empirical research fellow at the [University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School](https://www.law.upenn.edu/). My research is predominantly in the field of applied quantitative methodology, with recent work centering on developing methods for reliable and understandable causal inference in time-series cross-sectional settings and on the design and interpretation of factorial choice experiments. Substantively, I am broadly interested in political economy and law with a particular focus on international organizations and international trade/investment.

My research has been published in leading academic journals including: the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/), the [Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467985x), the [American Political Science Review](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review), [International Organization](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization), and [Political Analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis).

# Anton Strezhnev - Assistant Professor - Political Science - UW-Madison

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I received my PhD in 2018 from the Department of Government at Harvard University and was previously an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago from 2021-2025. Prior to this, I was a faculty fellow at NYUâ€™s Center for Data Science and an empirical research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. My research is predominantly in the field of applied quantitative methodology, with recent work centering on developing methods for reliable and understandable causal inference in time-series cross-sectional settings and on the design and interpretation of factorial choice experiments. Substantively, I am broadly interested in the political economy and law with a particular focus on international trade and investment, international organizations, and contracts.

My research has been published in leading academic journals including: the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A, the American Political Science Review, International Organization, and Political Analysis.
